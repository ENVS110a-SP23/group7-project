# Effect of Green Roofs on Air Quality and Heat Index in New York City
### ENVS 110A Semester Project: Gabriel Torres, Kyra Rivest, PerinAnn Katrak


## Project Background
With the increase of climate change impacts on the environment one of the ways in which we are looking to adapt to a host of different issues is through ways of green infrastructure. This has a very  wide range of applications and looks to tackle many different issues that are arising and will likely become more prominent in the future. For example, a lot of green infrastructure focuses on reducing the amount of discharge and waste getting into waterways, mainly through reducing speed and quantity of water by reducing impermeable materials. We however are looking to focus on green infrastructure regarding roofs which looks to tackle issues like air pollution and heating. This is especially important in major cities like New York City, which we are basing the research on, since cities create urban heat islands and contain a lot of emission of different types of chemicals. One of the strategies NYC is employing to help combat these issues is implementing cool roofs. Some implementations are as simple as using reflective paint while others are more complex types in terms of the use of new materials and infrastructure practices. There are new materials now which are able to help cool cities and sequester carbon along with other chemicals. This along with the implementation of new design and more green areas are all ways in which green roofs are expanding across New York as a climate solution. 

## Research Question
Do green roofs impact the environment by improving air quality or reducing heat in surrounding areas? 
We will look into the correlation between the prevalence of green roofs and the air quality and temperature in New York City. We will consider a number of factors, including the materials and quality of infrastructure involved in green roof construction, as well as the quantity and proximity of green roofs in an area. We will explore factors such as city layout, by comparing different boroughs of the city. Additionally, we might consider other green infrastructure, tree cover, or location of parks as these might have very similar impacts on the air quality and temperature of the city.


## Hypothesis and Next Steps
Since we are planning to focus our research question on air quality and/or heat, we will have two hypotheses to explore. Firstly, we hypothesize that the construction of more green roofs with more advanced materials reduce the amount of air pollution in NYC. Secondly, we hypothesize that it will also reduce the urban heat island effect in NYC. We will prove/disprove this by using our green roof dataset and air quality/heat datasets to determine if there is a correlation between the number of buildings with green roofs built in a year and improvements in air quality/temperature. This will be a time series study which we can plot in our final analysis. For both of these hypotheses, we will look at each NYC borough separately. Our next steps will be to begin cleaning our data and confirming that it can be used to answer our hypotheses. Additionally, weâ€™d like to conduct further research on how the evolution of green roof building materials may affect the efficiency of the roofs, as well as what other factors are also likely affecting changes in air pollution/heat.
