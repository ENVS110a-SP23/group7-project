# Effect of Green Roofs on Air Quality and Heat Index in New York City
### ENVS 110A Semester Project: Gabriel Torres, Kyra Rivest, PerinAnn Katrak


## Project Background

## Research Question

## Hypothesis and Next Steps
Since we are planning to focus our research question on air quality and/or heat, we will have two hypotheses to explore. Firstly, we hypothesize that the construction of more green roofs with more advanced materials reduce the amount of air pollution in NYC. Secondly, we hypothesize that it will also reduce the urban heat island effect in NYC. We will prove/disprove this by using our green roof dataset and air quality/heat datasets to determine if there is a correlation between the number of buildings with green roofs built in a year and improvements in air quality/temperature. This will be a time series study which we can plot in our final analysis. For both of these hypotheses, we will look at each NYC borough separately. Our next steps will be to begin cleaning our data and confirming that it can be used to answer our hypotheses. Additionally, weâ€™d like to conduct further research on how the evolution of green roof building materials may affect the efficiency of the roofs, as well as what other factors are also likely affecting changes in air pollution/heat.
